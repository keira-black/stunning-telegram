<h1>The story so far...</h1><br/>
Last night, you were drunk and watching Tower of Druaga, and you announced to your friends<br/>
that you could fight your way through a tower of supernatural monsters with both hands tied<br/>
behind your back. This morning, you woke up here...<br/>
On the bright side, your hands aren't tied! Not sticklers for detail, they. Come on, you've<br/>
got a bet to win!

Today, working on lighting, it looks more complicated than I thought ( no wonder there is an engine for it!) 
For some reason I had the wrong distance formula in my fake lighting engine. 
Got diagonals working
fake lighting engine still mysteriously not helpful, although I think I know why now.
It needs to happen at some point prior to both the players acting. Maybe I can put in a thing for that?
added graphics, somehow. Well, actually it had inbuilt support for graphics, but it was still a little tricky.
attempted to add portal to unlock next level, no bones so far, getting weird error that freezes game, "cannot read property 4 of undefined". It is referenced on line 900-and-so of the document,
and has something to do with the draw function. I found some ambiguous code and removed it but I'm still getting it.

Final day!
Added three levels!
Monsters now get more powerful with each level.
Resolved multiple portals bug.
Resolved bug where monsters were not powerful enough.
Made it so character gets stronger with each level as well.
Resolved the issue of the character just getting more and more swords all the time.
Came up with a loosely plausible storyline (except the part where your friends all have a freakin' magical tower).
Added more sprites to sprite sheet for all the level monsters.
Did simple bug testing, did not get actual testing-testing done.

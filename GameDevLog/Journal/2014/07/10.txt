Played with page layout, got it slightly fancier looking and things centered.
Removed bootstrap layout; not sure of how major an overhaul resizeable dungeons would be. It seems like it might not be that hard, but I am not sure.
I think it would involve simply creating large and small tile sets and changing some of the map features.
Toyed with color scheme. Not totally happy with it yet.

<h1>Wednesday 09 Jul 2014</h1>

<p>
Today should be a really interesting day, as I accidentally destroyed my index.html file, which shouldn't be too tricky, but is nevertheless - slightly tricky.<br>
I got multiple monsters, but they are invisible for some reason<br>
I got the character sprite changing direction with the arrow pads.<br>
I got the monsters to be visible. I also was able to pass the achievements and scores to the result pages. <br>
Had to replace jquery $() selectors with document.getElementById to access play() and pause() functions. I don't know if jquery is not up to date with the latest<br>
html5 stuff or whether it is a problem with my VERSION of jquery, but it does not matter as there is a simple work around.<br>
I will read up on the getElementById vs the $() selector and see whether I am missing anything later.<br>
I downloaded a bunch of sound effects and got background music working.<br>
Lighting engine now working.<br>

<h1>Tuesday 08 Jul 2014</h1>

<p>
Today, working on lighting, it looks more complicated than I thought ( no wonder there is an engine for it!) <br>
For some reason I had the wrong distance formula in my fake lighting engine. <br>
Got diagonals working<br>
fake lighting engine still mysteriously not helpful, although I think I know why now.<br>
It needs to happen at some point prior to both the players acting. Maybe I can put in a thing for that?<br>
added graphics, somehow. Well, actually it had inbuilt support for graphics, but it was still a little tricky.<br>
attempted to add portal to unlock next level, no bones so far, getting weird error that freezes game, "cannot read property 4 of undefined". It is referenced on line 900-and-so of the document,<br>
and has something to do with the draw function. I found some ambiguous code and removed it but I'm still getting it.<br>

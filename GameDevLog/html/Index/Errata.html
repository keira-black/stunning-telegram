<h1>Errata</h1>

<p>
Created Monday 07 July 2014<br>
</p>

<p>
For future releases, things that might be cool:<br>
-a proper inventory system<br>
-unit tests and E2E tests<br>
-more detailed art, bigger tiles<br>
-more detailed plot / storyline<br>
-saved games / audit trail in C# like in our Casino project.<br>
-generally handling transferring data between pages via ajax requests rather than exposing them on the front end, implementing security<br>
-more or less the future of this project is in C#.<br>
-moving back to bootstrap, and having the spritesheet be a variable that switches out when you resize the page, might be an interesting experiment.<br>
-figuring out genuine animated sprites. Right now, the character changes direction when you change direction by toggling the underlying symbol.<br>
Finding out definitively whether the current version of rot.js supports animated gifs might be interesting. If it does not, figuring out a 'hacky' solution might be cool.<br>
If we wanted to go CRAZY:<br>
Rot.js has asynchronous movement support, so we could introduce an initiative stack<br>
we could work on putting in randomly generated monsters, those are super fun<br>
adding edges to walls - I have the resources for it, what I need is to basically traverse the map with a couple of nested for loops, and inside those another couple of nested for loops with conditionals<br>
to check whether or not there is a square there, or a map edge or whatnot, and figure out which tile to replace that blank tile with (if it is blank).<br>
Rot.js also has stacking tile support, so I could have transparencies on my mobs and stack them.<br>
I could actually learn how rot.js's lighting algorithm works as far as rendering sprite tiles instead of just implementing a hard lighting system.<br>
As long as we're tracking player data, we could put in a leader board.<br>
Or heck, use a giant, statically generated world, with asynchronous players logged into the same environment, and let 'em chat with each other.<br>
Cause that would be cool, you know?<br>
-it might be nice to separate out things more by aspect as well, such as logging and so on, although globalvars works as a service of sorts and might serve as the potential basis for an eventual logging file.<br>
</p>

<p>
-More code comments, unit tests, etcetera.<br>
